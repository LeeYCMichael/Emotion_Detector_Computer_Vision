# Emotion_Detector
This aims to be able to detect human emotions using a neural network

This is a solo project done by me. I aim to create a model that is able to detect human emotions based on 7 different classes.
0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral

This was achieved via the use of neural networks thorugh the use of the tensorflow library.
As of now, the model is still unable to work in the best possible manner, only being able to predict 2/12 correct emotions based on pictures of myself. 
Thus, it is very much still work in progress.
